# Livability
Welcome! This is a repo for TDI to get a sense of my initial proof-of-concept for a project. 

I'm exploring the idea of creating a personalized livability web dashboard, one that lets the user weigh weather, transportation access, population density, air quality and a few other metrics. This project will aggregate conventional livability metrics with personal preference inputs, such as weather preference and proximity to other cities (e.g., friends and family).

## Where is the best place for you to live?

* Time calls the coronavirus outbreak: “World’s Largest Work-From-Home Experiment” 
* In 2020 (before the arrival of COVID-19) there were already 7 million people working remotely in the U.S
* We want information and decision-making support.

The portion of employees able to work remotely is increasing, resulting in decoupling a company’s geographic location from worker’s choice of where to live. This opens up the possibility to choose where to live based on other metrics, such as local air quality, affordability, proximity to family, ‘good’ weather.

Existing livability indices (e.g., https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Liveability_Ranking) are useful, in a generic way, yet they are not customizable. This project will aggregate conventional livability metrics with personal preference inputs, such as weather preference and proximity to other cities (e.g., friends and family) into an online dashboard for anyone to search for their best place to live.

For ~600 cities: latitude/longitude, population density, consumer price index, average particulate matter concentrations (PM 2.5) as a proxy for air quality, duration of shortest travel to other cities in the list;  renting affordability index; frequency of mention of city name in proximity to certain keywords related to specific activities {to start: surfing, hiking} on social media. 

In the data some cities are better represented than others, and so the reconciling will mean either having fewer cities participate. To date, my initial exploration has yielded some datasets with as few as 32 cities, however manually searching for some data may increase that minimum.
