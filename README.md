# Livability
Welcome! This is a repo for TDI to get a sense of my initial proof-of-concept for a project. 
I'm exploring the idea of creating a personalized livability web dashboard, one that lets the user weigh weather, transportation access, population density, air quality and a few other metrics. This project will aggregate conventional livability metrics with personal preference inputs, such as weather preference and proximity to other cities (e.g., friends and family).
